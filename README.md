Created for HXCI competitions. 

## Previous HXCI event code
The [SimilarWordsMessager](https://github.com/JayDwee/SimilarWordsMessager) was created for 'last comment wins'. Unfortunately this was banned from the competition within a minute of running it ðŸ˜­

## Speedrun Any%
First attempt: `11 seconds`
After which I caused code to be banned from all future HXCI events... oops

## Modifying Custom Words
You can either change the values in `hyperx.py`, or you can create another file `x.py` containing a dictionary, then replace the hyperx import on line 6 of `main.py` with your new file name and dictionary name, importing as CUSTOM_WORDS.

## Running the Program
```python3 main.py```
